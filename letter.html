Dear First and only Bestie in States 💖🇺🇸,<br><br>
Yk how much I prefer personalized gifts for my loved ones, so here's a lil different way i chose to wish you 🎁✨<br><br>
You are one of the best and most important part of my life 💕 Thank you for being there through thick and thin.<br><br>
I hope this season brings you warmth, laughter, and everything good ☕❄️<br><br>
May your holidays be filled with joy ✨ and your new year with endless growth in professional 💼, personal 🌱, and religious 🕊️ paths.<br><br>
To many more memories together - Boba drives, ONE TIME ONLY matcha drinks, shopping & many more matching things to buy!!
I can’t wait for you to teach me dance moves to perform at your wedding someday 💃😂<br><br>
With lots of love 💞,<br>
Your Bestie 🤍
