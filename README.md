This is a shell game I created to wish my best friend a MERRY CHRISTMAS. 
There are 5 gift boxes shown, one of them has a letter in the box. 
It at first shows which box has the letter and then shuts it, you later follow the right box when it shuffles the boxes. 
When you pick and click on the right box, it shows you a message - the letter inside with the wishes. 
You get 3 total tries if you miss it on the first shot. If you lose all three 3 times, then the letter gets burned out, and you don't get to read it. 



Easy and simple. I am planning additional changes, like asking the participant to choose easy, medium, and hard, ie, the difficulty level of the game.
